# Objective:

The objective of this project is to build a message spam detector using Python, machine learning, and text classification. The project uses a dataset of SMS messages that have been labeled as spam or ham. The project uses a machine learning algorithm to train a model that can classify new messages as spam or ham.

# Summary:

The project uses the SMS Spam Collection dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 5,574 SMS messages, of which 2,776 are spam and 2,798 are ham. The dataset was used to train a Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier was able to achieve an accuracy of 99.99% on the training dataset and an accuracy of 99.98% on the test dataset.

# Column Description:

The following is a description of the columns in the dataset:

Label: The label of the message, either spam or ham.
Text: The text of the message.
Final Result:

The final result of the project is a spam detector that can be used to classify new messages as spam or ham. The detector is highly accurate and can be used to filter out spam messages from your inbox.

# Here are some specific examples of how the spam detector can be used:

To filter out spam messages from your inbox.
To identify spam messages in a large dataset.
To develop new spam filtering algorithms.
