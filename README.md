# Summary 

This repository contains the code for a message spam detector that I built using Python, machine learning, and text classification. The project uses a dataset of SMS messages that have been labeled as spam or ham. The project uses a machine learning algorithm to train a model that can classify new messages as spam or ham.

The dataset used for this project is the SMS Spam Collection dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 5,574 SMS messages, of which 2,776 are spam and 2,798 are ham. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:
